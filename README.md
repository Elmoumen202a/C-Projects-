# C Practice Repository 🔧

This repository is my dedicated space to **learn** and **practice** the C programming language. Here, I’ve gathered various projects and exercises that I’m working on to improve my C coding skills. From basic concepts to more complex challenges, each project is a step forward in my coding journey.

## 🌟 What's Inside?
- **Essential Programs:** Start with the basics—loops, conditionals, arrays, and pointers.
- **Advanced Challenges:** Take on data structures, algorithms, and memory management.
- **Project Ideas:** Get inspired with mini-projects to apply your knowledge.

## 🛠️ How to Use
1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/Elmoumen202a/C-Projects-.git`
2. Explore the folders and files, each focusing on different C concepts.
3. Pick a file, read the instructions, and start coding!
4. Compile and run your code with: `gcc filename.c -o output && ./output`

## 🚀 Let's Get Coding!
C is more than just a language—it’s a gateway to understanding how software works at its core. Join me as I dig deeper, one line of code at a time. Ready, set, code! 💻🔥
